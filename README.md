This project has two minor variations of the same design.

dpoe2coax_fixture - This is for deburring the slightly wider small PCB chip used in the DPOE Acoustic System Cable where the PCB mates a 1 x 4 connection shielded cable to 2 x coax cables

twin2coax_fixture - This is for deburring the mating twinax cable to coax cable

Note: twin2coax_fixture is the one that comes first. dpoe2coax is a clone of it with the dimension changes.


The project is GPL Lesser License 2.1 for people to reuse.
